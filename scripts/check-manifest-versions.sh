# Report drift between an application's package version and every place its
# gallery manifest claims a version.
#
# The single source of truth is `project(<id> VERSION x.y.z)` in the solution's
# CMakeLists.txt: CPack names the deb from it and opkg records it. Everything
# else is a copy.
#
# There are two kinds of copy, and only one of them can be generated away:
#
#   1. solutions/<id>/rootfs/usr/share/<id>/<id>.json
#      Ships inside the app's own deb. cmake/package.cmake overwrites its
#      version with PROJECT_VERSION at package time, so what installs is always
#      correct -- but a stale value in git still misleads whoever reads it, so
#      it is checked here too.
#
#   2. solutions/supervisor/rootfs/usr/share/supervisor/apps/<id>.json
#      Ships inside the *supervisor* deb so the gallery can advertise apps that
#      are not installed yet. The supervisor build cannot see another
#      solution's PROJECT_VERSION, so nothing generates this one. It is the
#      copy that rots quietly, and the only defence is this check.
#      Where the app also ships its own manifest the two must be identical --
#      the built-in is meant to be a copy, not a variant.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-manifest-versions.sh          # report drift, exit 1 if any
#   scripts/check-manifest-versions.sh --fix    # rewrite the copies, then report
#
# zsh-compatible: no associative arrays, no bash-4 features (macOS ships 3.2).
